This Readme contains information concerning the use of the Maude implementation of our model of parallel architectures.


* Pre-requisites
  -------------------
  
  Maude 2 or higher 
  Maude home-page http://maude.cs.uiuc.edu.
  
* Explanation of files
  --------------------------
  1. core-config-parallel.maude
  
      This module explains the run-time syntax of the operational semantics. 
      
  2. architecture-parallel.maude
  
      This module explains various objects in the configuration and the cache memory structure on the basis of 
      associativity. It also explains about main memory architecture
      
  3. local-rules-parallel.maude
  
     It includes rewriting rules and equations for global and local semantics.
     
  4. core-test-parallel.maude
  
      This module shows some initial configurations namely config0, config1,...These configurations 
      can be used for simulations.
      
  5. test-file-parallel
  
      This file has some search conditions which will verify some of the invariants. 
      
 * How to simulate the this Maude model
   ---------------------------------------  
        Download the file 'wrla2016maude.zip' and extract it. In order to simulate the model, first invoke Maude interpreter.Then type 'load core-test-parallel.maude'. The  'core-test-parallel.maude' module will bring all other modules in Maude user-interface. 
        Then the 'frew {config0}' command will simulate the initial configuration {config0}. All other configurations can be 
        simulated in the same way.
        
  * How to use search conditions
  ---------------------------------------
  
     The 'test-file-parallel.maude' file includes some search conditions. One can copy and paste each search condition
      in Maude user-interface after loading the 'core-test-parallel.maude' module. Any initial configuration(config0, config1,...) 
      can be used for these search conditions.
